# TheJukebox

## Before Using It

You need to be in the project Whitelist in order to make use of this website. Contact me at *ferran98campos@gmail.com* to get into the white list and start using the app.

Make sure your user's track queue is empty. Otherwise the app won't work as desired.

## Features
    - **Most Listened**: Returns a playlist with your top 50 most listened tracks.
    - **Playlist Mix**: Generates a playlist with songs that you saved in your most recent playlists (20 playlist at most)
    - **One Artist**: Randomly picks one of the artist you follow, and returns a playlist with its most listened songs
    - **Susprise me**: Randomly selects one of the three other options

## Navigation

### Power the Jukebox Up
    Remember to turn the Jukebox on to use it. You can do so by logging into Spotify and pressing the Power bottom on the upper right corner. You'll know when the Jukebox is one as its neon lights will light up!

### Choose a Feature
    You won't be able to play any song until you choose an option. You can find more details about them in the _features_ section. You need to click on the button next to the label to select them. You will know you selected it when the labels turns purple.

### Play a Song
    Navigate through your playlist by using the scroll menu. You can scroll left/right by hovering the arrows on its sides. You can select any song, any time, by click on its album cover. You will get more information about the song once you hover the album cover.

### Pause a Song
    You can click on the big album cover (the one in between the speakers) to pause it. You will notice its paused once the pause icon appears on top of it, and the speakers stop moving. You can either pause a song by turning the jukebox off. Once you turn it on again, it will continue playing the song.
